# SimpleSQL

In this SQL Query, I created a very simple table that organizes different soccer cleats. 

I had 4 different columns for the table which include: Name & Brand of cleat, an unofficial price of the cleat, a durability rating, and an overall rating.

I organized the table at the end by the price of the cleats and also by the overall rating AND prices under $99.99.
